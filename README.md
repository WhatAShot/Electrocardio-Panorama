# The code to synthesize Electrocardio Panorama

This repository contains the code and datasets for our IJCAI 2021 paper *Electrocardio Panorama: Synthesizing New ECG views with Self-supervision*.

We propose a new concept called **Electrocardio Panorama**, which allows doctors to observe the ECG signals from any viewpoints and only requires one or few ECG views as input.

The code is just for reference, and is coming in these weeks.

Please cite the paper if the codes or dataset labels are helpful:
