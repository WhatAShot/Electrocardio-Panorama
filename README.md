# The code to synthesize Electrocardio Panorama

This project is the code and datasets about *Electrocardio Panorama: Synthesizing New ECG views with Self-supervision*.

We propose a new concept called **Electrocardio Panorama** in the paper, which allows people to observe the ECG signals from any viewpoints and only requires one or few ECG views as input.

The code is just for reference, and is coming in these weeks.

Please cite the paper if the codes or dataset labels are helpful:
